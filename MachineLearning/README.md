# Machine Learning — Price Prediction (Regression Model)

### Random Forest vs Neural Network (Keras)

This project builds a **machine learning regression model** to predict pricing using structured tabular data.  
Two different ML models were implemented and evaluated:

| Model | MAE (€) | RMSE (€) | R² Score |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Random Forest (Best Model) | **10,760.37** | **16,655.33** | **0.765** |
| Neural Network (Keras) | 14,723.70 | 19,961.00 | 0.662 |

## Project Goal

To predict price using key independent variables and to compare performance between:

- Traditional ML technique (**Random Forest**)  
- Deep Learning model (**Neural Network using Keras**)
